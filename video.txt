*Theme: Will go over two different implementations of anagram to show
	off ownership.
*The main ideas we want to get across is ownership. It is the most unique aspect of rust
	in that it handles memory managment in a way no other language does. 

*The two code samples we want to show are anagrams done with types and with 
	literals to show how the rules of ownership differ for both. 

*The demo of the programs will be a close look at each implmentation and how they
	pass variables around. The main goal is to cover all the rules of ownership
	and how they differ for literals and types. 

*Most likely we will just do a screen capture of the two programs with some text defining
	what we are talking about.

The first program is anagrams implemented with string types. It is fully functional. The second
program will be implemented with string literals so that we can highlight how ownership affects the
two. 

To run anagram we have been using Visual studio Code with a rust extension. With our anagram folder go
to file and add folder to workspace add our anagram file to the workspace. Then anagram should show up
in your workspace left click on anagram and select open in terminal to get the terminal for that project
Then just type cargo build to compile and the cargo run to run the program.

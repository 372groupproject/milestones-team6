Main.rs has the various code snippets for showing off Ownership. Currently all but one mod is being
commented out. To run each snippet simply uncommenet out the mod and the corresponding call in main to see
how each one perfroms. Some have intentional errors to show how Ownership affects passing variables. 

Simply add the p5 folder as a new workspace to Visual Studio Code with a rust extension and type
cargo build
cargo run

To look at the various snippets just uncomment the code you wish to run. Or you could uncomment all of it but
given some have intentional errors this will likely cause conflict among the various snippets.

Main.rs prints out hello world and then calls another rust program testing.rs.
The goal of the second program was to show how we can use other rust programs in our main using mod. 
And then showing how to pass variables and then print out changes.

To run the code it needs to be in the same file and the use commands cargo build and cargo run to compile and run the program.

Not entirely sure what to put in the Makefile for a rust program. Or for a Makefile in general hopefully the cargo run and build commands are enough but I doubt it.
